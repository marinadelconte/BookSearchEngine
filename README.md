## Description
The Book Search Engine is an application that was created using React, MERN stack, node.js/express.js and graphql. My task was to take starter code for a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. 


## Installation
This application can be accessed at the link below. Upon entering the site, you will want to sign in or create an account to begin saving books.

Here is a link to the deployed application: https://limitless-taiga-59709-c8b8e6dbc195.herokuapp.com/  


## Credits
We were provided starter code to begin working on this project. Additionally, I reached out to my tutor and instructional team for support where needed.
